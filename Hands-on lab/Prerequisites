# Machine Learning before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1. Microsoft Azure subscription must be pay-as-you-go or MSDN

    - Trial subscriptions will not work. You will run into issues with Azure resource quota limits.

    - Subscriptions with access limited to a single resource group will not work. You will need the ability to deploy multiple resource groups.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

### Task 1: Create your Azure Databricks Account

Azure Databricks is an Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for Azure that supports data engineering and machine learning and deep learning workloads.

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+ Create a resource**, then type "Azure Databricks" into the search bar. Select Azure Databricks from the results.

    ![Select create a resource, type in Azure Databricks, then select it from the results list.](images/create-azure-databricks-resource-01.png 'Create a resource')

2. Select **Create**.

    ![Select Create on the Azure Databricks service page.](image/../images/create-azure-databricks-resource-02.png 'Create an Azure Databricks workspace')

3. Set the following configuration on the Azure Databricks Service creation form:

    - **Workspace name**: Enter a unique name as indicated by a green checkmark.

    - **Subscription**: Select the subscription you are using for this hands-on lab.

    - **Resource Group**: Select **Create new** and provide the name `MCW-AI-Lab`.

    - **Location**: Select a region close to you. ***(If you are using an Azure Pass, select South Central US.)***

    - **Pricing**: Select Premium.

    ![Complete the Azure Databricks Service creation form with the options as outlined above.](images/azure-databricks-create-blade.png 'Azure Databricks Service Creation Dialog')

4. Select **Create** to finish and submit.

### Task 2: Create an Azure Databricks cluster

You have provisioned an Azure Databricks workspace, and now you need to create a new cluster within the workspace.

1. From the side menu in the Azure portal, select **Resource groups**, then enter your resource group name (e.g., `MCW-AI-Lab`) into the filter box, and select it from the list.

2. Next, select your Azure Databricks service from the list.

    ![Select the Azure Databricks service from within your lab resource group.](images/select-azure-databricks-service.png 'Azure Databricks Service')

3. In the Overview pane of the Azure Databricks service, select **Launch Workspace**.

    ![Select Launch Workspace within the Azure Databricks service overview pane.](images/azure-databricks-launch-workspace.png 'Launch Workspace')

    Azure Databricks will automatically log you in using Azure Active Directory Single Sign On.

    ![Azure Databricks Azure Active Directory Single Sign On](images/azure-databricks-aad.png 'Sign In to Databricks')

4. Select **Clusters** (1) from the menu, then select **Create Cluster** (2).

    ![Select Clusters from menu then select Create Cluster.](images/azure-databricks-create-cluster-button.png 'Create Cluster')

5. On the Create New Cluster form, provide the following:

    - **Cluster Name**: lab

    - **Cluster Mode**: Standard

    - **Databricks Runtime Version**: Runtime: 6.2 (Scala 2.11, Spark 2.4.4)

    - **Enable autoscaling**: Uncheck this option.

    - **Auto Termination**: Leave checked and in the text box enter `120`.

    - **Worker Type**: Standard_DS3_v2

    - **Workers**: 1

    - **Driver Type**: Same as worker

   ![Complete the form using the options as outlined above.](images/azure-databricks-create-cluster-form.png 'Create New Cluster Dialog')

6. Select **Create Cluster**. It will take few minutes to create the cluster. Please ensure that the cluster state is running before proceeding further.

### Task 3: Install libraries on the Azure Databricks Cluster

The notebooks you will run depends on certain Python libraries that will need to be installed in your cluster. The following steps walk you through adding these dependencies.

1. From the left-hand menu in your Workspace, select **Clusters**.

    ![The Clusters menu option.](images/azure-databricks-clusters.png "Clusters")

2. In the list of clusters, select your cluster. Make sure the state of the cluster is `Running`.

    ![The list of Interactive Clusters.](images/azure-databricks-clusters-list.png "Interactive Clusters")

3. Select the **Libraries** link and then select **Install New**.

    ![The Libraries tab showing the Install New button.](images/azure-databricks-cluster-libraries.png "Install New")

4. In the Library Source, select **PyPi** and in the Package text box type `azureml-sdk[automl_databricks,interpret]` and select **Install**.

    ![The Install Library dialog showing PyPi as the source and azureml-sdk as the package.](images/azure-databricks-install-library.png "Install Library")

5. An entry for azureml-sdk will appear in the list with a status of installing followed by installed.

### Task 4: Upload the Databricks notebook archive

1. Within the Azure Databricks Workspace, using the command bar on the left, select Workspace, Users and select your username (the entry with house icon).

2. In the blade that appears, select the downwards pointing chevron next to your name, and select Import.

3. On the Import Notebooks dialog, select URL and paste in the following URL:

    `https://github.com/microsoft/MCW-Machine-Learning/blob/master/Hands-on%20lab/notebooks/AI%20with%20Databricks%20and%20AML.dbc?raw=true`

4. Select **Import**.

5. A folder named after the archive should appear. Select that folder.

6. The folder will contain one or more notebooks. These are the notebooks you will use in completing this lab.

### Task 5: Create your Azure Machine Learning Workspace

1. In the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+ Create a resource**, then type `Azure Machine Learning` into the search bar. Select `Machine Learning` from the results.

    ![Select create a resource, type in Azure Machine Learning, then select it from the results list.](images/create-aml-resource-01.png 'Create a resource')

2. Select **Create**.

    ![Select Create on the Machine Learning service page.](images/create-aml-resource-02.png 'Create an Azure Machine Learning workspace')

3. In the Create Machine Learning Workspace dialog that appears, provide the following values:

    - **Workspace Name**: AML-workspace

    - **Subscription**: Choose your Azure subscription.

    - **Resource group**: Select the resource group in which you deployed your Azure Databricks workspace.

    - **Location**: Choose a region closest to you (it is OK if the Azure Databricks Workspace and the Azure Machine Learning Workspace are in different locations).

    - **Workspace edition**: Select `Enterprise`.

    ![Entering configuration values in the Create Machine Learning Workspace dialog.](images/create-aml-workspace.png 'Azure Machine Learning Workspace Creation Dialog')

4. Select **Review + Create** and then select **Create** on the dialog that appears.

### Task 6: Download training data to your local machine

1. Download the data from https://databricksdemostore.blob.core.windows.net/data/connected-car/daily-battery-time-series-v2.csv. Please ensure that the name of the downloaded file is `daily-battery-time-series-v2.csv`. Make a note of the location where you saved the file as you will need it during the lab.

You should follow all these steps provided _before_ attending the Hands-on lab.
